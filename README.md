# jekyll-test-site
A test repository to transfer my portfolio website to run on Jekyll

Currently my portfolio website is in the 'mxkoder.github.io' repository (https://github.com/mxkoder/mxkoder.github.io ), and is hosted at https://agnesbeviz.co.uk/ .

This repo is to learn how to use Jekyll, with an aim to eventually move my portfolio website to run on Jekyll.
